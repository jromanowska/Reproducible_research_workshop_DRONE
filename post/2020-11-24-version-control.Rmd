## Too many versions?

We produce very many files, scripts, notes, code, data, outputs, drafts, reports, you-name-it...
It's important to have a clear strategy for how to maintain order in those
and how to track changes or versions - either made by us or others.

## Take control!

Here are some tips

### Directories

In the directories that you know will be useful for others (or even for yourself,
after the project is finished) keep and maintain a `README` file.

```
This directory contains very important analyses and data.

|-- input_data:
|     here are all the raw inputs
|
|-- input_cleaned:
|     the data from 'input_data', but ready for analyses
|     (here are also scripts that were used for cleaning)
|
|-- analysis_
```

> DO NOT use names such as "analysis1", "data2" - these do not give any meaning to anyone apart from yourself and that only during the time you're doing "analysis1"

### Naming strategy

- be consistent!
- be descriptive!
- use uderscore (`_`) instead of spaces
- avoid strange characters (`Â« / :?*> [ ] & $`)
- write dates as YYY-MM-DD

### Version control

[Git](https://git-scm.com/) is a decentralized version control system, which
means that each of the copies (`clones`) of the repository are version controlled
separately and can be merged upon request. Thanks to that, the repository doesn't
have to be online and each clone can "live" on its own, without even contacting
the "mother-repository".

When learning version control, there are some vocabulary that one needs to 
understand:

|  _command_     |  _meaning_                    |
|----------------|-------------------------------|
| `clone`        | copy the entire repo, together with its version history  |
| `branch`es     | separate histories of files, co-existing within one repo |
| `stage`        | each new/changed file needs to be staged so that git can track the changes  |
| `commit`       | staged files are gathered in one commit and a __meaningful__ commit message describes the changes  |
| `push`         | all the commits are stored locally and need to be pushed to the server, if one wants to share them |
| `pull`         | copy the changes from the repo on the server  |

> Here, also pay attention to the commit messages!
> Below is an example of how __not to__ write them:

### What to version control?

It's useful to include in the repo __text files__, i.e.,

- code
- scripts / syntax
- notes
- text output
- text results

These files can be easily checked for differences and thus only the changes (`diff`)
are saved in the history, which makes the information stored much smaller.
All the __binary files__ need to be re-written each time they're changed, thus
taking lots of space in the git history storage. Therefore, be careful when
including these files:

- images
- pdf
- Word files, Excel files (apart from .csv)
- any other files that cannot be opened with Notebook

### Examples

When working with git everyday, you will find doing the following workflow
many many times:

1. work with files
2. stage the changed files
3. commit and give a description of the changes
4. (push if you're working outside of SAFE)
