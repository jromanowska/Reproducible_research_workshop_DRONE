    To think, you have to write.
    If you’re thinking without writing,
    you only think you’re thinking
        — Leslie Lamport, Thinking for Programmers

## Note-taking

Important to take notes, both via hand-writing, but also digital notes.

Advantages of digital notes:

- searchable
- ease of planning
- facilitates writing manuscripts
- keeping track of trials *- mistakes and failures are as important as successes!*

## Organization

Organize your thoughts, links, workflows, etc. Make it easier for others to
understand your thoughts, but also for yourself, when looking at that piece of
research after e.g., 5 years.
