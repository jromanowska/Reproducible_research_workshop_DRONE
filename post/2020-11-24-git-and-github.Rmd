Git and GitHub are connected, but these are not the same. Let's see what's
the difference.

## Git software

[Git software](https://git-scm.com/downloads) can be downloaded for all OS types.
Moreover, there are many software pieces that give you git access, e.g.,

- [Sourcetree](https://www.sourcetreeapp.com/)
- [Github desktop](https://desktop.github.com/)
- [Rstudio](https://rstudio.com/products/rstudio/)

> YES, you read correctly: **you can use git without closing RStudio**

### Git in RStudio

> **NOTE:** To use this feature, you need to have Git installed in your system!

There are three ways one can turn on git history tracking in RStudio.

#### Creating new project

Click on "New project" and choose "New directory". Then, mark the option
`"create a git repository"`

### Cloning a repository

Click on "New project" and choose "Version control"

### Adding git tracking to an existing project

Click on "Tools" in the menu, and then "Version control" and "Project setup...".
In the window, choose "git" from the drop-down menu. You will need to restart
RStudio.

And finally, you will get a new tab:

There, you can easily:

- check changes (`Diff`)
- stage new changes
- create commits (`commit`)
- check history (`History`)
- pull and push changes

## GitHub

[Github](https://github.com/) is a web-service that lets you create, manage,
and share files through a repository system. You need to create an account to
use it.

There can be two types of repositories:

- private
- public

Only the public repositories will be visible to others. Private repositories
are hidden and only you can manage who can see those and who can have access.

Github visualizes your git history, lets you navigate to files and subdirectories,
and integrates various useful services that come handy especially when you're working
in a team. It doesn't have to be programming. Github is used also to store
documentation, create plans for analyses, maintain workflows, etc.

### Github features

**Issue tracker**

- very useful when you want feedback from others or a place to discuss things!

**Wiki**

- keep your documentation and notes at hand, right next to the code

**Pull requests**

- for more advanced use, but still very helpful!
- let's say you publish an R package and let people use it
- someone wants to implement an extra feature in your package
- instead of asking you to get access to your repository, they would:

    - clone the repo
    - implement necessary functions
    - create a pull request for you to review

- thus, you can check whether you want to include this extra functionality in your package
- pull requests are visible as new "issues", so you can discuss live with the other developers and e.g., ask them to change something before the new features are accepted

**Github pages**

- you can publish your own webpage, without "dirtying" yourself in HTML or CSS!
